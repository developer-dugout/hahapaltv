Live Streamer
Hello Developer Team!! 
Thank you for the video and I will try my best to explain in words and pictures for the kind of looks we want to have in the website =) Live streaming works and commenting and payment process looks great! Here are things we want to have it changed or added ( Those ones are not new and were included in the proposal ) !
It might sound cold but as we mentioned on the proposal, we need a live streaming website look like Afreecatv.com or Twitch tv . This looks like at least 10-20 years old website with 1998 version msn emoticons.. everyone in the team pointed out this part . 
We need a version that is up to the date -recent designs (2017-2020) 
Video screen, chatting screen , emoticons …etc , - needs to be updated to recent ones! 
I will explain more with pictures and explanation ! 

For WEBSITE COLOR, The background can keep in BLACK, 
 Most of letters and button will be in white or Blue/ Light blue.
Red is ONLY Logo and something very important like SIGN UP button. Take most of the red out from the website and replace to skyblue or white, please! Thank you! 












#1 – HOME PAGE
 
X with the green ones > Take it out.  
Arrows are what we want in there.
It will be just two types of video (RECENT HOT CLIPS)   - Just 4 videos showing on the main page, and if they want to see more hot clips videos they can go to VOD or click “MORE HOT CLIPS” button
Under the 4 videos, Section name called “ LIVE NOW  (Recommended streamers) ““This will show all the live streamers video in orders of popularity.

 
And BLACK CIRCLE is what we want to add on HAHAPAL website. 
Very similar or same look and where it is on Afreeca TV ! 
Search bar,  GO LIVE with Camera emoticon.  
Red LIVE box on the top left of EVERY live streamers video. 











#2 – LIVE STREAMING PAGE
  



 

 




# 3 –LOG IN PAGE
    
CAN WE USE THIS TV LOGO, If Developer team’s designer can re-design to black background or transparent logo , that would be great!! If not, please let me know to order one to online logo designers.

 
“You must log in to access this service.” On the bottom of the logo.
#4 – SIGN UP PAGE
 




#5 – BUY Hahacoin PAGE
 

This is kind of look we want users to see.  More friendly approaching Hahacoin purchasing page. This is from Afreeca TV.  Can we put a TV logo and make a nice coin image?    << Developer team’s designer re-design this example, and make a nice tv coin please!!





Thank you very much for the changes! 
I understand the website is just a roughly done, but We want to have a similar design and look with Afreeca TV, and Twitch TV. If you haven’t please have a visit to Afreeca TV . That is very similar to what we want to have it done.   Also, seems like about half of features from the proposal were not updated on the website yet!  ( Users ranks and Colors, need a lot more update on Start live section , language and translating..etc)  The website is not considered as COMPLETE unless everything in the proposal is completed ( at least added on the website). 
I talked to the team and CUSTOMIZABLE THEME (LIGHT/ DARK MODES)  part from the proposal can be removed! We should just go for black background with white+light blue+blue letters and buttons +red logo , 
Don’t need to bother to make a two set colors for White background mode and Black background mode. Just 1 set (Black background mode) would be good !  Thank you so much for working while your team is having a hard time with Covid , We really appreciate it!
